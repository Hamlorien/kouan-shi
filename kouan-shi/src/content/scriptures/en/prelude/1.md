# Sunlight on a Pure Heart

## True Meaning
#### The sacred light from the heavens chooses to illuminate those who live embracing a bright resolve within their hearts.

## Interpretation
#### Above all, live with brightness. This brightness is unique to each person. It does not mean you must imitate those who are always brimming with energy. It is enough to simply think positively within your heart, in a way that is true to you.

## The Path of Practice
First, let us add just one "small brightness" to our day today.
For instance, take three slow, deep breaths. Bathe in the morning light for just a moment. Mindfully prepare a cup of tea at your favorite temperature—that is more than enough.

There are as many forms of brightness as there are people. There is no need to force yourself to imitate the energy of others.
Gently repeat to yourself in your heart, "I am fine at my own pace."

On days when you stumble, do not try to force the light to be stronger; simply do not blame the clouds.
An overcast sky is still a form of the sky. Decide that today is a day for protection, and rest early.

When night falls, find one good thing from your day and put it into simple words.
"I made it on time," "I was able to reply," "I washed my face"—no matter how small, each becomes a wick for tomorrow's light.

Without rushing, without comparing, little by little.
Brightness is not something to be "made," but something to be "noticed."
As these moments of awareness accumulate, the path before you will be gently illuminated.
