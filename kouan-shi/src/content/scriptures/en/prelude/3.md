# Unhindered in Annihilation

## True Meaning
#### Because all is fated to disappear, truth is found in feeling your own presence in this very moment, and letting go of idle thoughts.

## Interpretation
#### No matter what, all things will eventually disappear. Therefore, now is the time to release the distracting thoughts that bind your heart. The essential thing is your own existence, right here, right now.

## The Path of Practice
Today, for just a single moment, let us feel "the self that is right here, right now."  
Close your eyes, take a breath, and feel the weight of your body and the beating of your heart. That alone is proof that you are truly here.

Freedom is not about achieving something.  
The very act of "being"—for any existence—is itself changing the world.

If a day comes when your mind is clouded with distracting thoughts, close your eyes and whisper, "This is not needed."
If it is something you will eventually forget or overcome, then it is no different than it being gone right now.

And even if you cannot forget, the world itself will one day end. This is both a loss and a liberation.  
To gaze upon the self that exists in this instant, to affirm that you are changing the world, is to open the door to freedom.

No matter how complex the day, if you believe in the self that is here now, a path will surely open.  
And at the end of that path awaits a you who is whole, just by "being."
